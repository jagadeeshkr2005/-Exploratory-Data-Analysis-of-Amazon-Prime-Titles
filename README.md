# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Amazon-Prime-Titles-Dataset
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on analyzing the Amazon Prime Titles dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships within the platform’s content library. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the structure, distribution, and growth of movies and TV shows available on the platform. The dataset includes key attributes such as content type, release year, rating, genre, duration, country, and date added, which provide valuable insights into content strategy and audience targeting.

The analysis begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting column formats, and extracting relevant features such as the year content was added. Univariate analysis is performed to examine the distribution of individual variables such as content type, ratings, and genres. This helps identify dominant categories and overall content composition. Bivariate and multivariate analyses are conducted to explore relationships between variables, such as content type versus release year, genre versus rating, and rating distribution across different content categories.

Visualizations such as bar plots, heatmaps, count plots, and grouped charts are used to represent patterns clearly and effectively. These graphical representations reveal that movies dominate the content library compared to TV shows, and that content additions have increased significantly in recent years. The rating distribution indicates a stronger focus on teenage and adult audiences, while family-friendly content represents a smaller proportion. Genre analysis highlights that Drama, Comedy, and Documentary are among the most prevalent categories.

Overall, this EDA project provides a comprehensive understanding of the platform’s content distribution and growth trends. The findings support data-driven insights that can assist in strategic decision-making, audience segmentation, and future content planning.

Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of digital streaming platforms, understanding content distribution, genre trends, release patterns, and audience-targeted categories has become crucial for strategic decision-making. The Amazon Prime Titles dataset contains information about movies and TV shows, including attributes such as title, genre, release year, rating, country, duration, and type.

However, raw datasets often contain missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates, and unstructured information. Without proper analysis, it is difficult to extract meaningful insights that can support business decisions such as content acquisition, market expansion, and audience targeting.

The purpose of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to systematically examine the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, identify key patterns and relationships, detect anomalies, and transform raw data into meaningful insights. EDA helps in understanding content trends, genre popularity, production distribution across countries, and time-based growth patterns, which can assist in strategic planning and recommendation systems.

Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are:

Understand the dataset structure and variables:

To explore the dataset’s dimensions, data types, features, and overall composition, ensuring clarity about each variable’s meaning and relevance.

Perform data wrangling and data cleaning:

To handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, standardize formats, and prepare the dataset for accurate analysis.

Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis:

→ Univariate analysis to examine individual variables such as genre frequency or release year distribution.

→ Bivariate analysis to study relationships between two variables, such as content type vs rating or country vs number of titles.

→ Multivariate analysis to analyze interactions among multiple variables simultaneously for deeper insights.

Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies:

To detect content growth over years, dominant genres, country-wise distribution, rating trends, and any unusual or extreme values in the dataset.

Summarize insights for decision-making:

To convert analytical findings into structured insights that can help stakeholders understand platform content strategy and audience preferences.

Provide conclusions and actionable recommendations:

To draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis and suggest practical recommendations, such as focusing on specific genres, expanding in certain regions, or optimizing content categories.
